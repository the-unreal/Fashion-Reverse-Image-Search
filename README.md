# Fashion-Reverse-Image-Search

A reverse image search trained on MNIST Fashion Dataset. Created as a basic skeleton for a future reverse image search for landmarks.
The image search takes a picture of any clothes and will return similar such clothes from the MNIST Fashion Dataset.

Used Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and Auto-Encoders for Dimensionality Reduction.

# Directions

Run the execute.py file and as the parameter, pass the path of the image you want to search.

python execute.py --image {file _path}
